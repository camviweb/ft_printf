# Projet en cours ðŸ‘¾
- Recoder printf()
- Page 9/9 done 
- **A variadic function** is a function which accepts a variable number of arguments. 
- bien structure et extensible ?

## To code
- [ ] yes %p The void * pointer argument has to be printed in hexadecimal format. (Print the address of a pointer or any other variable. It's a format specifier which is used if we want to print data of type (void *))

## To test
- [ ] norminette
- [ ] file names/git repo
- [ ] guidelines -> main
- [ ] valgrind (no leaks)
- [ ] "your Makefile must not relink"
- [ ] Your libftprintf.a has to be created at the root of your repository.
